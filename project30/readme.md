1) {-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}

OverloadedStrings: This extension allows string literals to have types other than String, specifically types that implement the IsString type class. This is incredibly useful for working with text types like Text (from the text package) or custom string-like types without needing explicit conversions. It makes code cleaner and more concise when dealing with various text representations.

2) {-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}

ScopedTypeVariables: This extension allows you to bring type variables into scope within a function or expression using a forall quantifier. This is particularly useful when you need to be explicit about the type of a variable, especially in situations involving higher-rank types or when dealing with type ambiguities.

3) {-# LANGUAGE LambdaCase #-}

LambdaCase: This extension provides a more concise syntax for writing lambda functions that immediately pattern match on their argument. Instead of \x -> case x of ..., you can write \case .... This can significantly improve the readability of code that involves many small pattern-matching lambdas.

4) {-# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #-}

DeriveGeneric: This extension, along with GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving, automates the generation of instances for various type classes (like Show, Eq, Ord, Functor, Foldable, Traversable, and others) based on the structure of your data types. This reduces boilerplate code and makes it easier to work with custom data types.

5) {-# LANGUAGE BangPatterns #-}

BangPatterns: This extension introduces strict evaluation for function arguments using the ! symbol. By default, Haskell is lazy, meaning expressions are only evaluated when their results are needed. Bang patterns allow you to force the evaluation of an argument, which can be important for performance in certain situations, especially when dealing with numerical computations or when you want to avoid space leaks caused by accumulating thunks.

6) {-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications #-}

TypeApplications: This extension allows you to explicitly specify type arguments when calling polymorphic functions. This can be helpful in resolving type ambiguities, especially when the compiler cannot infer the desired type, or when you want to be more explicit about the types being used.

7) {-# LANGUAGE RecordWildCards #-}

RecordWildCards: This extension provides a convenient way to access all fields of a record within a function body or pattern matching. Instead of listing each field individually, you can use .. to bring all fields into scope with names matching the field names.

8) {-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}

FlexibleContexts: This extension relaxes the restrictions on type class contexts in instance declarations. Normally, the context in an instance declaration must be a subset of the context in the class definition. FlexibleContexts allows for more general contexts, which can be useful when working with more complex type class hierarchies or when you need instances with more specific constraints. Use with caution, as it can sometimes lead to more complex type inference.

9) {-# LANGUAGE AllowAmbiguousTypes, TypeApplications #-}

AllowAmbiguousTypes: This extension allows you to define functions where the type of an argument or result is not fully determined by the context within the function itself. This is often used in conjunction with TypeApplications or type class constraints to resolve the ambiguity at the call site. It's particularly useful for defining functions that operate on types that are only known at the point of use. Use with caution, as it can make type inference more challenging.

10) {-# LANGUAGE GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving #-}

GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving: This extension allows newtype declarations to inherit instances from the underlying type even for type classes that the underlying type doesn't directly implement, as long as the class is defined in a specific way (using deriving via). This can significantly reduce boilerplate when working with newtype wrappers.

11) {-# LANGUAGE StandaloneDeriving #-}

StandaloneDeriving: This extension allows you to derive instances for type classes separately from the type definition. This can be useful when you want to derive an instance for a type class that wasn't available when the type was originally defined, or when you want to keep the type definition cleaner by separating the instance declarations.

12) {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses #-}

MultiParamTypeClasses: This extension allows you to define type classes that take more than one type parameter. This is essential for defining relationships between multiple types, such as in type-level programming or when working with concepts like conversions or associations between types.

13) {-# LANGUAGE MultiParamTypeClasses, FunctionalDependencies #-}

FunctionalDependencies: This extension is often used in conjunction with MultiParamTypeClasses. It allows you to specify dependencies between the type parameters of a multi-parameter type class. This can help the compiler infer types more effectively and can also be used to enforce certain relationships between types.

14) {-# LANGUAGE TypeFamilies #-}

TypeFamilies: This extension allows you to define functions at the type level. Type families can be used to compute types based on other types, enabling more sophisticated type-level programming and allowing you to express constraints and relationships between types in a more powerful way.

15) {-# LANGUAGE GADTs #-}

GADTs (Generalized Algebraic Data Types): This extension allows you to define data types where the return type of the constructors can vary. This provides more fine-grained control over the type of data that can be stored in the data type, enabling you to express more complex invariants and relationships at the type level.

16) {-# LANGUAGE ExistentialQuantification #-}

The ExistentialQuantification extension allows the creation of data types that can hold values of different types, as long as those types satisfy a certain constraint, typically being an instance of a particular type class. This is achieved using the forall keyword in the data constructor definition to introduce a type variable that doesn't appear in the result type of the constructor. Existential types are particularly useful for creating heterogeneous collections, where you need to store a list or other structure containing elements of different types that share a common interface. It provides a way to abstract over the specific type of a value while still retaining the ability to perform operations defined by the constraint.

17) {-# LANGUAGE TypeOperators #-}

The TypeOperators extension allows the use and definition of types with operator names. In standard Haskell, operator symbols are primarily used for value-level functions. With TypeOperators, you can use symbols like :+:, @@, or --> as names for type constructors or type synonyms, and you can use them infix in type signatures. This can be particularly useful for creating type-level syntax that closely mirrors notations used in specific domains, such as mathematics or logic. It can lead to more readable and domain-specific type-level code.

18) {-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

Template Haskell stands as a potent metaprogramming feature within Haskell, granting developers the ability to craft code that programmatically generates other Haskell code during compilation. This capability unlocks opportunities for automating repetitive coding tasks, such as deriving typeclass instances, constructing optimized data accessors, and even embedding domain-specific languages directly within Haskell. For instance, one could leverage it to automatically produce serialization and deserialization logic for various data formats or to build type-safe interfaces for interacting with external systems. Nevertheless, the adoption of Template Haskell introduces an additional layer of complexity to the compilation process and can complicate debugging efforts, as the code being executed is dynamically generated rather than directly written. Furthermore, Template Haskell operates within the monadic context of Q and employs specific splicing syntax ($, $$), necessitating a thorough grasp of compile-time evaluation to harness its potential effectively and circumvent potential complications.

19) {-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}

Language extension that disables Haskell's default monomorphism restriction. This restriction normally forces certain expressions without explicit type signatures to be given a less general type than they could have, preventing some ambiguities at the cost of expressiveness. By enabling the NoMonomorphismRestriction extension, programmers can write more polymorphic code without having to add explicit type signatures, allowing functions to retain their most general possible type. This is particularly useful when working with numeric functions or in contexts where you want maximum type flexibility, though it can occasionally lead to confusing type errors when the compiler can't determine which concrete type to use in ambiguous situations.

20) {-# LANGUAGE PartialTypeSignatures #-}

Haskell's PartialTypeSignatures extension offers developers a flexible middle ground between fully explicit and completely inferred type signatures. This pragma allows programmers to specify only the portions of a type signature they care about while leaving other parts as wildcards (denoted by underscores), which the compiler then automatically infers. This feature proves particularly valuable in complex functional programming scenarios where full type signatures would be verbose or when working with intricate higher-order functions, polymorphic types, or large data structures. By combining the safety of explicit typing with the convenience of type inference, PartialTypeSignatures reduces boilerplate code while maintaining type safety, making Haskell code more maintainable and allowing developers to focus on expressing program logic rather than wrestling with elaborate type annotations.

21) {-# LANGUAGE NumericUnderscores #-} 

The NumericUnderscores extension in Haskell allows programmers to use underscores as visual separators in numeric literals, making large numbers more readable without affecting their value. For example, instead of writing 1000000, you can write 1_000_000, which is easier to read at a glance. This feature works with all numeric types and notations in Haskell, including decimal integers (1_234), floating-point numbers (3.141_592), hexadecimal (0xFF_AA_BB), octal (0o777_777), and binary (0b1010_0110) literals. The underscores are purely for human readability and are ignored by the compiler during interpretation. The extension became enabled by default starting with GHC 8.6.1, so modern Haskell code can use this feature without requiring an explicit language pragma.
